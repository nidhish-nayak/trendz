## About the Project

Trendz is a full-stack application featuring social media functionalities such as posts, likes, uploads, etc. This project is built using Typescript, React, Express, React Query, PostgreSQL and so on. We will be implementing the features with Context APIs to maintain simplicity as much as possible so that anyone can understand the process.

## Installation üíª

To make the whole application run locally on your computer, you have to run both `client` and `server` separately in the terminal simultaneously. You will also need to setup your own AWS S3, .env file and configure the endpoints in both client and server using `config/config.ts` file.

### Project setup:

Follow the steps below to setup the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nidhish-nayak/trendz.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd trendz
    ```

> You can use `npm / yarn / pnpm`. Just replace `pnpm` with `npm` or `yarn` for all the commands.

### Frontend setup:

To run the client locally, follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install the dependencies using pnpm / npm (make sure you have pnpm installed):

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Start the development server for frontend:

    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173/` to access the frontend of LinkX application.

### Backend setup:

Setting up the server is similar to frontend setup given above. Follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the api directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server for backend:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/` to access the backend of LinkX application.

> **Note**
> Make sure both client and server are running locally for the fullstack features to work.

### Testing:

Testing your code if it runs as expected can be done using the below command for server.
Integration and Unit tests cover almost all the functionalities that are critical for the application.
Make sure to follow `.env.example` file to get all the test cases working.

1. Navigate to server:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Run all test cases:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

3. Run individual test cases based on the describe names:

    ```bash
    jest -t "<Any test case describe title here>"
    ```
